Reliability - The ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) - How quickly a servic
Mean Time between Failures(MTBF) - The average time between service disruptions

# Design for operation: Theory

# How Complex Systems Fail
  - Change introduces new forms of failure
  - Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them
  - All complex systems are always running in degraded mode

# Lean Approach
  - Build
  - Measure
  - Learn
  - Repeat

# Metrics

i) Service Performance and Uptime
  - Synthetic checks
ii) Software Component Metrics
  - Ports and processes of host
iii) System Metrics
  - Time series metrics
iv) App Metrics
  - What your application is doing
v) Performance
  - APM - application performance management
  - RUM - real user monitoring
vi) Security

# Logging
Five Ws of Logging
 - What happened
 - When did it happen
 - Where did it happen
 - Who was involved
 - Where did that entity come from

# Centralized Logging principles

- Don't collect data you won't use
- Keep logs for as long as they can be used.
- Alert only on what you must respond to.
- Don't exceed business security needs.
- Logs change.
