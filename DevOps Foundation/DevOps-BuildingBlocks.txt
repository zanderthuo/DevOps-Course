# Manifesto for Agile Software Development
 - We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it 
   and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

Lean - A systematic process of eliminating waste.

Seven Principles of Lean Software
  i) Eliminate waste.
  ii) Amplify learning.
  iii) Decide as late as possible
  iv) Decide as fast as possible
  v) Empower the team
  vi) Build in integrity
  vii) See the whole

    ## Forms of Waste in Software Development
      - Partially done Work
      - Extra features
      - Relearning
      - Handoffs
      - Delays
      - Task Switching
      - Defects

    ## Build, Measure, learn
      - Build the minimum viable product.
      - Measure the outcome and internal metrics.
      - Learn about your problem and your solution.
      - Repeat. Go deep where it's needed.
