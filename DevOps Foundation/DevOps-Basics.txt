What is DevOps - The practice of operations and development engineers participating together
                 in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process
                 to production support

               - Five Levels of DevOps:
                  i) Values
                  ii) Principles
                  iii) Methods
                  iv) Practices
                  v) Tools

                  DEVELOPMENT          +          OPERATIONS
                   - Developers                    - System admins
                   - Front end                     - Network admins
                   - Backend                       - Database admins
                   - QA

DevOps core Values: CAMS

Culture
Automation - People, process and Tools
Measurement
Sharing

Principles:
 (The three ways(phoenix project, Lean IT) )
  - Systems Thinking -> We should focus on overall outcome of the entire pipeline of value chain.(To create team processes)
    From Concept to Cash
  - Amplify Feedback Loops -> Use when creating multi-team processes
                           - Visualizing Metrics
                           - Designing delivery flows
                           (To create team standards)
  - Continuous Experimentation - Try to see what work or what doesn't work(As part of management style)

# DevOps Methodologies
i) People over Process over Tools
ii) Continuous Delivery - Coding, testing and releasing code in small releases
iii) Lean Management - Work in small batches
                     - Work in progress limits
                     - Feedback Loops
                     - Visualization
vi) Visible ops-style Change Control - Eliminate fragile artifacts
                   - Create a repeatable build process
                   - Manage dependencies
                   - Create an environment of Continuous improvement
v) Infrastructure as Code - System treated like Code
                          - Checked into source Control
                          - Reviewed, built, and tested
                          - Managed programmatically
