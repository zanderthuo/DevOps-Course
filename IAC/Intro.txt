- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

- Imperative - Also known as Procedural; an approach where the commands
               to produce a desired state are defined and executed in order.
- Declarative(functional) - You define a desired state and the tool conforms
                            the existing system to the model.

- Artifacts - Deployable elements coming out of your build process compiled 
              executables, OS packages, VM images, etc.

    # 3 Areas of Infrastructure Testing
      - Unit Testing - Tests the smallest testable components.
      - Integration Testing - Tests a real running system.
      - Security Testing - For both positive and negative security attributes.
