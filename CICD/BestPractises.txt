# Best practices in CI/CD
  - Each Developer is responsible for their check-in through deployment
  - Small changes. Build quality in.
  - Don't check in broken builds.
  - Own your build
    - Take responsibility for your build
    - Immediately address a broken build
    - Revert if fixing takes time
    - No check-ins while build is broken-the line stops
  - Automate high-quality testing.
  - Run tests before check-in
  - Fix flaky tests
  - Don't ignore or disable tests.
  - Automate deployments.
  - Keep the build and deploy first.
