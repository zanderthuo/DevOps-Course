# Good Tests
  - Are fast
  - Are reliable
  - Isolate failures for you

# Types of Testing
- Unit testing - Peformed at build time on a single unit of code and/or artifact
                 without use of external dependencies or deployment
                 Example tools: JUnit, XUnit, Rspec
- Integration testing - Performed as you bring together pieces of your application
                        and as it needs to use external dependencies
                        Example tools: Abao/RAML and Serverspec
- End to end (UI) testing - Performed to exercise the full flow of your application
                            in the same way an end user would
                            Example tools: Selenium and Protractor
- Security testing - Performed to look for flaws in your code and runtime to prevent
                     compromises and leaking of data in production
                     Example tools: FindBugs, Fortify, and Gauntlt

# Testing Terminologirs
  - Shift left - Move testing as eary as possible in the development process, ideally
                to the dev desktop.
  - Test fixture - A set of objects used to run a test in a well-known environment
  - System under Test (SUT) - The application and system on which you are running your tests
  - Cycle time - The time from when an item (feature or bug fix) is worked on until it is
                 delivered into production
  - Lead time - The time taken from when an item (feature or bug fix) is requested until it is delivered
                into production
  - Mock - Code designed to stand in for a piece of code that contains external dependencies to enable
           unit tests.

# Testing Philosophy
  - Test Driven Development (TDD) - The practice of writing a failing test first, and then writing the code that causes the test to pass.
  - Behavior-driven development (BDD) - The practice of writing tests in a simple end-user-behavior-centric language.
  - Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) - The practice of agreeing on acceptance tests before development to establish what is to be delivered

# The Big Three Testing Metrics
 - Cycle time - time from the start of work to delivery
 - Velocity - value delivered per unit time
 - Customer satisfaction - How well a product/service met the Customer's needs. NPS scores and bug reports work well here.
